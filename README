This repo holds code for the 192-strip Germanium Detector's GUI.

NOTES:
1) qtGSD_GUI.py 
    - this script runs the GUI
    - uses python2.7, and is run from APSshare
    - python path can be modified in the first line of code.
    - imports window and button layout from qtGSD_DESIGN.py
    - imports matplotlib
    - connects buttons to actions, eg. running gsd_parse.cc

2) qtGSD_DESIGN.ui
    - this file can be opened and modified with QT4_Designer on linux
    - after modifications are made, run the convert script 

3) convert_qtGSD_DESIGN.cmd
    - run this script to convert the .ui file to .py which is required
    - requires APSshare

4) qtGSD_DESIGN.py 
    - this file is imported by qtGSD_GUI.py
    
5) gsd_parse.cc
    - this script must be compiled locally: g++ gsd_parse.cc -o gsd_parse.out
    - note that nStrips=384 because the firmware was written for the 384 detector
        - channels from missing asics are not printed to the output file (192 x 4096 table)
